							<p>Built so that students save time when joining their online classes.</br>This is a script that runs in the user's machine, the first time it runs it will show the user the online conference programs their machine has installed that are compatible with ClassAutomation. Then, the program will ask for the schedule of the student, asking which day and at what time the user wants to run each compatible applications (supported applications at the moment: Cisco Webex Meetings, Microsoft Teams and Zoom). After the user enters their schedule, the script will run in the background until any scheduled class time comes. When this time comes, the script will launch the specific application the user has that class with and join the specific class session.</p>
							<p>We came up with this project idea when various teachers were giving their classes on different platforms, it was hard to keep on when we had no break between classes. That is when ClassAutomation comes in handy, after you have entered your class schedule, the program will independently of what you are doing, launch the proper conference application. Without having to lose track if you took a 2 minute break. We hope this tool helps students to be on time in their online classes.</p>
