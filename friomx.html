							<p>A sports simulator that depends on team's statistics to emulate scores. It has a fully functional betting system, where the user has to create an account and deposit some money to start betting. From now on the process is simple, the user selects the matches they want to bet in befote the match "happens" and when the match ends the final score will be shown to the user and the result of their bet. If they win their bet, depends on how high the reputation of the team was the user will get their initial bet multiplied by. The more the reputation the team has, the less you are risking, the less the user will profit from it and the less the reputation the team has, the more you are risking, the more you will profit when your bet wins. (Higher risk = Higher reward)</p>
							<p>At first, this was a school project, but then I decided to continue developing it because I liked where this idea was going. This application even makes the user think that these matches between teams are real, because of the evident behavior similarities with the real matches. We have tweaked every single aspect of the application to make it mimic real matches where the team that has better statistics has a bigger chance of winning but, that is not always the case. As in real life, we tweaked the program to have that unpredictability that real life matches have.</p>
